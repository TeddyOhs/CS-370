## Project README
### Overview
In this project, I implemented a reinforcement learning algorithm to train an agent to navigate through a maze. The core components of the project included the implementation of Q-learning with experience replay and the training loop to iteratively improve the agent's performance.

Code Contribution
The provided code consisted of a template for the qtrain function, which outlined the structure of the training loop and included placeholders for various parameters such as exploration factor, epoch count, memory size, and data size. Additionally, utility functions for time formatting and evaluation were also provided.

My contributions involved filling in the missing components of the qtrain function, including the implementation of the training loop, handling exploration-exploitation trade-offs, training the neural network model, and tracking the training progress through epochs. I also implemented error handling, validation checks, and documentation within the codebase to ensure its reliability and readability.

Connection to Computer Science
Role of Computer Scientists
Computer scientists play a crucial role in developing innovative solutions to complex problems by leveraging principles from mathematics, statistics, and other disciplines. They design algorithms, develop software systems, and analyze data to address various challenges across industries.

Problem-Solving Approach
As a computer scientist, approaching a problem involves breaking it down into smaller, more manageable components, designing algorithms and data structures to solve them efficiently, and iteratively refining solutions through testing and experimentation. This problem-solving approach is evident in the implementation of the reinforcement learning algorithm to train the maze navigation agent.

Ethical Responsibilities
Computer scientists have ethical responsibilities to both end users and organizations. When developing software systems or algorithms, they must consider the potential impact on individuals, communities, and society as a whole. Ethical considerations include ensuring fairness, transparency, privacy, and safety in the design and deployment of technology.

Ethical Considerations
In the context of this project, ethical responsibilities include ensuring that the trained agent behaves safely and responsibly when deployed in real-world scenarios. Additionally, considerations such as fairness in the training process and transparency in the decision-making of the agent are important ethical considerations. By adhering to ethical guidelines, computer scientists can build trust and confidence in the technology they develop.

Conclusion
This project provided an opportunity to apply concepts from reinforcement learning and neural networks to solve a practical problem. By reflecting on the work done in this project and its broader implications within the field of computer science, it becomes evident that computer scientists play a significant role in shaping the future of technology and its impact on society.
